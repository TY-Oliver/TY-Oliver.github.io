## Lesson_1_讨论童年

### Part 1

Hey, are these pictures of you when you were a kid? 

Yeah, that’s me in front of my uncle’s beach house. 

When I was a kid, we used to spend two weeks there every summer. 

Wow, I bet that was fun!

Yeah, we always had a great time! 

Everyday we used to get up early and walk alone the beach.

I had a great shell collection. 

In fact, I think it still up in the attic. 

Hey, I used to collect shells too when I was a kid but my parents threw them out. 

### Part 2

You know what I remember most about growing up? 

What? 

Visiting my grandparents’ house, you know, on holidays and stuff. 

They lived way out in the country, and my granddad had a horse named Blackie. 

He taught me how to ride. 

I just loved that horse and she loved me, too! 

I used to really enjoy spending time at my grandparents’ house. 

And every time I came back, Blackie remembered me. 

Ah, memories.

## Lesson_2_问路

### Part 1

Excuse me, could you tell me where the bank is? 

There’s one upstairs, across from the duty free shop. 

Oh, thanks!

 Do you know what time it opens? 

It should be open now. It opens at eight a.m.. 

Good! And can you tell me how often the buses leave for the city? 

You need to check at the transportation counter.

 It’s right down the hall. 

Okay, and just one more thing. 

Do you know where the nearest restroom is? 

Right behind you, ma’am, see that sign? 

Oh, thanks a lot.

### Part 2

Excuse me. It’s me again. I’m sorry. 

I need some more information if you don’t mind. 

Not at all.

Thanks. 

Do you know how much a taxi costs to the city? 

Well, it depends on the traffic, of course, but it usually costs about 40 dollars. 

40 dollars? I guess I’ll take the bus. 

That means I’ll have almost an hour till the next one. 

Where could I find an inexpensive restaurant in the airport? 

Maybe a fast-food place? 

Go upstairs and turn right, you’ll see the snack bar on your left. 

Thanks very much. 

Have a nice day! 、

You,too.

## Lesson_3_餐厅

### Part 1

Hey, this sounds good, Snails with garlic. 

Have you ever eaten snails? 

No, I haven’t. 

oh, they’re delicious. 

I had them last time. 

Let to try some? 

No, thanks. 

They sound strange. 

Have you decided on an appetizer yet? 

Yes, I’ll have the snails please. 

And you, sir? 

I think I’ll have the fried brains. 

Fried brains?

 Now that really sounds strange. 

Oh, good!

### Part 2

 Here comes the waitress now. 

Here are your snails, madam. 

And for you, sir, the fried brains. 

Thank you. 

Hm, these snails are delicious. 

How are the brains? 

Well, I think they’re yuck. 

Oh, sorry, I guess brains are pretty strange after all. 

Em, I think I’m going to order something else if you don’t mind. 

Oh, sure, go ahead. 

Miss, excuse me, Miss. 

Yes. 

Em, I really don’t care for this appetizer. 

Could you bring me something else. 

Yes, of course. 

What would you like instead? 

Try the snails. 

No, I don’t think so. 

I’ll tell what. 

Just forget an appetizer for me, and bring me a nice, juicy hamburger, medium rare, with French fries, and a large soda.

## Lesson_4_Wanna 1

The whole thing in accent reduction is to hear the music in the language because it isn’t your accent that’s the problem. 

It’s that you're trying to speak my language in the rhythm pattern of your language, and I can’t understand you. 

English is a beat-driven language. 

Everything we say can be drummed out. 

You’ve got to train your ear to hear the different musical notes as well as how the beats the rhythms. 

Practice this way and in no time, you’ll be speaking in the same kind of melody as does Jackie Chan.

The third point, particularly in English and particularly in North American English, we do not speak “one” “word” “at” “a” “time”. 

No, we speak in sound units. 

Where’s Bob? Bob is on the phone. 

We don’t ever speak word by word. 

So I always say to accent-reduction clients, everything that you have learned so far about the English language, you have learned with your eyes through textbooks. 

But when you’re learning to speak the language, get rid of all of that. 

Because you don’t want to see, you don’t want to read, you want to hear. 

Because you see and read one word at a time but we don’t speak that way.

## Lesson_5_Wanna 2

The only way you can develop an ear is to listen to the way in which native speakers of any language are speaking, and begin to imitate. 

One thing that people can do right now is stop and start this video as you’re listening to it and imitate everything I’m saying, because I’m speaking in standard north American rhythm patterns. 

Practice the music, and when you feel you’ve mastered that, go on to the next little phrase. 

When you imitate me, exaggerate it. 

Make the sounds big, because you want to train the organs of articulation we call them. 

You want to train the tongue, the cheeks, the lips and the whole mouth, How to help you make these sound units.

So exaggerate. 

It’s more important that you have the up and down of the language than it is saying it quickly. 

The most important thing is just keep practicing. 

That’s how we learned our mother tongues. 

Our mother held us, we heard her. 

And as we got old enough, and after we had heard her, and after we had developed the organs of articulation, we began to imitate our mom. 

So there’s no shortcut. 

There’s no “speak like a native speaker in 28 days” and if someone tries to sell you that package, it won’t work. 

## Lesson_6_Halloween

$\mathscr{B}$: Did you know next week is Halloween? It’s on October 31st.

$\mathscr{G}$: So what do you do on Halloween? We don’t have that holiday in Russia.

$\mathscr{B}$: Well, it’s a day when kids dress up in masks and costumes. They knock on people’s doors and ask for candy by saying the words trick or treat. 

$\mathscr{G}$: Hmm, sounds interesting.

$\mathscr{B}$: But it’s not just for kids. Lots of people have costume parties. Hey, my friend Pete is having a party, would you like to go?

$\mathscr{G}$: Sure, I’d love to.

 

$\mathscr{G}$:  So are we going to wear costumes to the party?

$\mathscr{B}$: Of course, that’s half of the fun. Last year, I rented this great Dracula costume, and this year I’m going as a clown.

$\mathscr{G}$:  A clown? Yes, you would make a good clown.

$\mathscr{B}$: Hey. 

$\mathscr{G}$: Oh, I’m just kidding. What about me? What kind of costume should I wear?

$\mathscr{B}$: Why don’t you go as a witch? I saw a terrific witch outfit at the costume store.

$\mathscr{G}$: A witch? Yeah, that’s a good idea. So after I scare people, you can make them laugh.

## Lesson_7_Singapore

​		Quite a number of things have been done to help solve traffic problems in Singapore. For example, motorists must buy a special pass if they want to drive into the downtown business district.They can go into the business district only if they have the pass displayed on their windshield.
Another thing Singapore has done is to make it more difficult to buy cars. People have to apply for a certificate if they want to buy a car. And the number of certificates is limited, not everyone can get one. There is also a high tax on cars. So it costs three or four times as much to buy a car in Singapore as it does in,say, the United States or Canada. The other thing, Singapore has done is to build an excellent public transportation system.Their subway system is one of the best in the world.And there’s also a very good taxi and bus system.

$\mathscr{B}$: It really upsets me when taix drivers drive so far. I'm always terrifed of having an accident.

### Part 3

$\mathscr{B}$: I can't stand it. When they show their same commercial twice in a row. Why do they do that? It drives me crazy.

$\mathscr{G}$: The thing that brother me the most is when they interrupt a ballgame at the exciting moment to show some stupid commercial.

## Lesson 12

### Spain

When I lived in Spain, I was suprised at how late people eat in the evening. When you are invited to dinner, you are asked to come around nine o'clock and you usually don't start dinner until 10. And people stay terribly late, Sometimes until 2 in the morning or even later. I found it difficult. How does one get up and go to work or school the next day after eating and drinking until 3 in the morning? 

### The Middle East 

I lived in the Middle East for a while. And when I went out, I had to obey the local custom of wearing something over my head and wearing a dress that covered my whole body.

$\mathscr{B_1}$: there's no elevator.

$\mathscr{B_2}$: Not to the top, but it's just 142 steps.

$\mathscr{G}$: Let me tell you a little more about the statue before you climb to the top. in case you're wondering what the statue is made of. it has a framework inside that's made of iron, the outer skin is made of copper, the copper skin is only 2.4 millimeters thick. The supporting frame work inside the statue is what holds the whole thing together.the statue of liberty is a major tourist attraction, and every year about 2,000,000 people from all over the world come here to visit it.

## Lesson 14_Change

Gosh, I really have to go on a diet. I’ve gained ten pounds since last year and everyone tells me I look fat. And if I don’t lose weight now, I won’t be able to get into any of my summer clothes.

I should take a typing course this summer. I really need it for my school work. And people say that if you can type really well, it’s something you’ll find useful later in life.

Yeah, I really need a change. I’ve been doing the same things for over five years now, and I’m just not learning anything new. It's the same routine every day. I'm really sick of sitting in front of computer. I think I need to try something totally different. I want to be in a profession that involves meeting people.

$\mathscr{B}$: Why? What would you do? 

$\mathscr{G}$: Well, I go straight to Las Vegas, and try my luck in the casinos. I could double the money in a day, and keep $750,000 for myself

$\mathscr{B}$: You might also lose it all in a day. And then you could go to jail.

$\mathscr{G}$: Hm……, you've got a point there.

### Part_2 

 $\mathscr{G}$: So what would you do If you found a lot of money?

$\mathscr{B}$: Oh, you know me, Kate. I'm so honesty I scare myself sometimes. I'd take the money straight to the police.

 $\mathscr{G}$: I gusses that wouldn't be such a bad idea. Maybe the owner of the money will give you a big reward.

$\mathscr{B}$: Well, they say honesty pays. Right?

## Lesson 17_Future

### Work

 $\mathscr{G}$: Work, in the future. Well, I think unemployment is going to keep getting worse. 

$\mathscr{B}$: I agree. As companies get more efficient and more computerized, they're finding ways of using less staff. 

 $\mathscr{G}$: So I gusses people will find it hard to get a good job, unless they have excellent qualfications.

$\mathscr{B}$: Hm……Yeah, I think that's probably ture. But I also think that because of computers, more and more people will be working at home instead of going into an office.

$\mathscr{B}$: And hopefully they will have found cures for many  of the diseases that around today. So people will live longer.

$\mathscr{G_1}$: And when did you move here? 

$\mathscr{G_2}$: I came here after I graduated from college. That was in 1992. 

$\mathscr{G_1}$: And what do you do now? 

$\mathscr{G_2}$: I'm a transportation engineer.
